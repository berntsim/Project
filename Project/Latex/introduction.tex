\section{Introduction}

This is the section where the introduction to the project will be written. For now, please just read the notes: 

This project has been on taking a Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) approach to the clumping of aerosols in the lower atmosphere in relation to emission from fossil fuelled based combustion (etc.). Diffusion-Limited Aggregation is an algorithmic approach to growth of structures where limited supply of mass is the bottle-neck. A number of different growth models have been proposed, however the first one was proposed by T. A. Witten Jr. and L. M. Sanders \cite{PhysRevLett.47.1400}. This model builds on the Eden model, first proposed by Eden \cite{eden1961}, but with a random walker determining the aggregation.  \textcolor{red}{Write something about Diffusion Limited Cluster Aggregation here!}
