\section{Introduction}

This is the section where the introduction to the project will be written. For now, please just read the notes: 

This project has been on applying a Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) approach to the clumping of aerosols in the lower atmosphere in relation to emission from fossil fuelled based combustion (etc.). Diffusion Limited Aggregation is an algorithmic approach to growth of structures where diffusion (in other words, lack of mass) is the limiting factor. It was first proposed by T. A. Witten Jr. and L. M. Sanders \cite{PhysRevLett.47.1400}.
